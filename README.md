# Supervised Machine Learning Using Regression Models

## DataScience Bootcamp Project 6 (Phase II) : WBS Coding School
Welcome to my sixth project in bootcamp & third project of Machine Learning using Regression models! This time I am predicting the exact housing prices for a real estate consultancy by using several models of Regression techniques in supervised machine learning.In the second phase of the project, the target variable will be numerical (the exact prices of the houses in dollars)

## Objective :
To create a model to predict the exact price of a house.

## Project Overview :
This is the second Phase of project using Regression methodology.The focuse from Phase I has been diverted from Expensive/Not-Expensive to exact prices of houses.As a Data Scientist we have to check for the best regression models to provide the outcome. We can evaluate the performances of models by using numerous metrics such as, R2 Score,RMSE score and by using different feature selection terminologies such as Recursive feature elimination,SelectFromModel and so on.

## Classification Vs Regression (w.r.to this Project)
In classification, we predicted discrete classes. Hence, a prediction was either correct or incorrect.However, regression tasks deal with continuous values. The exact prediction of a continuous value is improbable, meaning our model will almost always be slightly “off”. But, importantly, we can measure how close our predictions are to the true values.

## Challenges :
- Explore the dataset of about 1500 Houses.
- Analyzt about 80 features.
- Try out the different models of regression.
- Try out feature selection methods to eliminate columns which are least important(optional)

## Tasks :
- Explore the data & perform the data cleaning.(Here we are using the same dataset in previous phase)
- Perform splitting over data.
- Create a baseline model.
- Selct the models to see which model gives best result.
- Transform,scale & impute the data.
- Perform Error Analysis.
- Fit the train data again(This is for Kaggle Competition within our bootcamp Group)
- Perform predict on testing data & download the file with results(This is for Kaggle Competition within our bootcamp Group)

## Skills & Tools :
- Colab & Jupyter Notebook
- Regression Techniques(DecisionTree,Linear Regressor, SGD Regressor, RandomForest Regressor, GradientBoosting Regressor)
- Splitting data by importing train_test_split file
- Pipeline & Preprocessor Creation
- Scikit Learn, Cross Validation
- Fitting the data
- Performance metrics like R2 Score, RMSE.
- Select the model giving highest accuracy for final submission.

## Recommendation for Further Analysis :
- Use LazyPredict which helps understand which models works better without than I used in this project.
- In this project I skip to use Feature Selection but further analysis can be done using any of the method of it.
- Keep experimenting and try out new models to extract best results.
